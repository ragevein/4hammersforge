        <p>Ok so in order to make the goals more interesting and to ammuse myself here is the game.</p>
        <p>Season 1 rules (subject to change)</p>
        <p>First off, you are on your honor with this type of game. So NO CHEATING.</p>
        <p>Secondly, The aim of this game is to better one's self and reach a far off goal.  It's amazing how much more motivation it is to do something
            that is difficult when you can track and check a satisfying check box and see some sort of progress.  Trackable progress. </p>
        <p>Thirdly, a bit of healthy competition can go miles and help make medial tasks a touch less painful and hopefully make it fun. </p>
        <p>K. So each season is completed monthly.  The winner is determined by who has the most gold at the end of the season.</p>
        <p>There will be an opt in and we need to decide what the prize is.  Two options are on the table.  First is the winner is treated to dinner movie party.
            Paid by all the sad sad losers.  Or we all put in 5 or 10 bucks at the beginning of each season and winner takes all.
        </p>
        <h3>How do you earn the gold?</h3>  <p>You earn it by completing your daily/weekly etc goals.  You can also procure gold from your competition.  More on that later.
            You can have up to 7 dailys quests that net you a Rand(5,20) gold per. 4 Weeklys quests Rand(80,120) gold per.  And 4 Monthly Rand(300,400) per.  Yearly quests 
            obviously fall out of the scope of the season and don't net you any gold.  But hopefully all these other quests ultimately help you achieve such and help you 
            achieve or become your best self as well as have fun along the way.
        </p>
        <p>Also bonus quests will be implimented and if you complete all your daily quests you can have a run on TChest (still being worked on) and get extra gold that
             way.  And just for logging into the site daily will give you x gold also</p>
        <h3>Stealing from you competition.</h3>  <p>So each day as you Tick a box you can encourage your buddies by robbing them.  You get a greater chance of doing so if they haven't
            logged in for over 24 hrs or if they have completed far fewer dailys then you have.  You can also invest your own gold in the form of weapons and armor at the
            shop.  These weapons and arms increase you odds of theiving I mean entrepreneuraly activies.  So for every day missing grants your foes an extra 10% chance of 
            totally owning you.  This is designed to help encourage steady participation of all.  More of a reminder.  "Hey buddy remember you said you wanted your abs back?
            well do your 3 daily excersises and come play."
        </p>
        <p>Having trouble grappling with what freaking dailys am I going to set up?  Well they don't have to be all that difficult or interesting.  A simple quest can be
            a simple reminder to do something.  IE floss,Make bed, go for a walk.  You can even have quests that encourage you not to do something.  IE skip that beer you 
            desperatly want to guzzle down or 2 or 3 em and so on.  Or skip that treat that is calling your name when you fill up with gas.
        </p>
        <p>Unless you are really shy (I may add an option to hide the goal details), Your quests will be viewable by others to help ensure some sort of continuity. We
            want the game to be fair and fun.  We're all friends here.
        </p>
        <h3>Skirmish</h3>
        <p>Ok so the more fun part of the game.  Snaking your buddies stash once a day.  The base we are going to start at is you have 50% chance to do whatever.
            <ul>
                <item>Aggresive action - 40% chance of success + 10% each day away Rand(5,25) gold stolen from your target Also if you roll really low like a 1 on a 
                    D20 you can have a critcal fail and lose x gold to your target.
                </item>
                <item>Cohersive action -  50% chance of success + 10% each day away Rand(10,20) gold stolen from your target</item>
                <item>Diplomatic action -  60% chance of success + 10% each day away Rand(10,30) gold gained to you and your target</item>
            </ul>
            Some examples:<br>
            Aggresive: "Ragevein has deafeated one of you knights in single combat and pillaged 16g from your kingdom.  When pressed about the inccident Brohams vassal
            denied any wrong doing."<br>
            Diplomatic: "A trade agreament has been brokered between Broham and Bevanhousing.  Netting 22g each. Broham ships 200 tons of fertalizer (poop) in exchange
            for fine linens"
        </p>
        <p>And that's as far as I've gone so far.  Hit me up if you have any ideas changes that you think of.</p>
